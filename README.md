# TabularClassification
Tabular classification using classical machine learning algorithms, the goal is to predict flight delay.

# Motivation

I worked on this notebook with R in a Lab during my Data Science semester in UC3M. We didnâ€™t go very far in the analysis and only used 2 of bayes classifiers LDA and QDA without any CV, so I decided to go back to it and enhance the analysis, I also wanted to use a wide range of classifiers to compare the results.

The goal of this notebook is to predict if a flight is going to be late or not. This is a classification problem. The data set contains 9k flights from June to august 2014 for three Airports Atlanta ATL, Los Angeles LAX and Chicago ORD.
